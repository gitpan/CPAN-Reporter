# Features, etc
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- set alternate configuration file via environment variable

- use environment variable and/or external file to indicate modules to 
  skip for reporting

- ability to turn on/off via an environment variable (David Cantrell)

- remember which versions of which modules it has already reported on and not
  report on them again (David Cantrell)

- ability to only report on what I asked to install, not on its dependencies
  (David Cantrell)

- Add config to save reports to a file (Jerry Hedden)

- Check for system() call $? & 127 (only on Unix, though) or set a $SIG{INT}
  handler (for Win32); abort test without sending; key question: is this
  success or fail for return code to CPAN?  Probably the latter.  Or, prompt
  for both parts -- so hanging tests can be reported.

- Add an interface for CPAN.pm to pass in test output directly (e.g. from 
  Expect.pm) for report generation.

- Figure out if forced tests should be handled differently than normal
  tests

- In test programs, check that temp space gets created -- skip if can't 
  set up the test properly

- Add interactive config for editor

- Figure out where/how to capture Makefile.PL/Build.PL and make/Build results

- Figure out what Andreas is doing with locally applied patches in CPAN.pm

- Confirm up-to-date Test::Harness diagnostics ( Note -- modern CPAN
  may be forcing 2.62 in some situations, but not all)

- Look at CPANPLUS::Internals::Constants::Reports and try to 
  replicate that logic

- Improve test coverage for utility subs and error handling

- Consider tracking duplicate reports and avoiding submitting same report. 
  MD5 hash of report + Perl -V ?  save as filename in a cache dir?

- Check email addresses for validity (?)
