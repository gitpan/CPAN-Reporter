TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

- Customize report message for each grade with an explanation; mention that
  test reports received by email are due to the tester electing to cc the 
  author

- Include some/all of %ENV

- Include some of Config (compiler, make, lib/inc paths, etc.) and
  special variables like UID, EID, etc.; also toolchain like CPAN, M::B,
  EU::MM and version.pm

- Check for system() call $? & 127 (only on Unix, though) or set a $SIG{INT}
  handler (for Win32); abort test without sending; key question: is this
  success or fail for return code to CPAN?  Probably the latter.

- Add an interface for CPAN.pm to pass in test output directly (e.g. from 
  Expect.pm) for report generation.

- In test programs, check that temp space gets created -- skip if can't 
  set up the test properly

- Add interactive config for editor

- Figure out where/how to capture Makefile.PL/Build.PL and make/Build results

- Figure out what Andreas is doing with locally applied patches in CPAN.pm

- Confirm up-to-date Test::Harness diagnostics ( Note -- modern CPAN
  may be forcing 2.62 in some situations, but not all)

- Look at CPANPLUS::Internals::Constants::Reports and try to 
  replicate that logic

- Improve test coverage for utility subs and error handling

- Check email addresses for validity (?)
