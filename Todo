TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

- Improve handling of test.pl; should be OK with Module::Build as M::B always
  passes it to Test::Harness.  The question is whether or not to report
  test success/failures under ExtUtils::MakeMaker for test.pl.  Or run failed
  tests twice to capture output.

- Check failed tests for prerequisite failures -- this could
  occur if tests were forced.  Such failures should be marked N/A.

- Write some real tests and get some decent test coverage.  Would likely need
  to mock a bunch of things -- CPAN::Distribution, Test::Reporter

- Check email addresses for validity (?)
