TODO list for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

- Handle test.pl -- need to call system. Question is whether or not to report
test success/failures

- Add a "create_config" function that prompts a user through config
  file setup.  Add it to synopsis.
  
- Write some real test for coverage.  Would likely need to mock a bunch of
  things -- CPAN::Distribution, Test::Reporter

- Check email address for validity

- Consider checking failed tests for prerequisite failures -- this could
  occur if tests were forced.  Such failures should be marked N/A.
