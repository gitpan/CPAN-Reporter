# High priority

- none

# Medium priority 

- add T::R transport() support  if T::R is >= 1.34

- set alternate configuration file via environment variable

- Add config to save reports to a file (Jerry Hedden) (RT#24816)

- Log entire history of reporting, regardless of whether a report is sent
  (David Cantrell) -- i.e. keep discards somehow ("DISCARD" just like rest 
  of subject line?)

- Reorder report sections to put test results after tester comments

# Low priority

- figure out how to support color output from Test::Harness 3.0 -- probably
  set an environment variable to get them to pass color strings to the pipe
  and then strip color escape codes from the teed file.

- switch from a single flat file for history. e.g.
    - SDBM_File for history (key on subject line, with phase as value?
      Or key on distro name/perl with result and phase as value? ) -- but
      does it scale well?  (See MJD's article)
    - Or use sorted file with Search::Dict(?) -- (prefer this option,
      keeps search for non-existant line fast; insertion is a just a few
      block writes and a rename.) If we do this, need to put distro name
      first to make "have_tested()" easier to write
    - Use filesystem to index -- one file per distname? hash with directories
      to keep number of files/directory down?

- add timeout to prompt (RT#28034)

- Figure out if forced tests should be handled differently than normal
  tests

- Add interactive config for editor?

- consolidate UID/EUID/GID/EGID output to 1 or 2 lines

- Improve test coverage for utility subs and error handling

- Check email addresses for validity (cf. Email::Valid, etc.)

# Probably won't implement

- ability to turn on/off via an environment variable (David Cantrell)

- ability to only report on what I asked to install, not on its dependencies
  (David Cantrell)

- use environment variable and/or external file to indicate modules to 
  skip for reporting
