NAME
    CPAN::Reporter - Provides Test::Reporter support for CPAN.pm

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.99_01.

SYNOPSIS
    From the CPAN shell:

      cpan> install CPAN::Reporter
      cpan> reload cpan
      cpan> o conf init test_report

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Reporter is an add-on for the CPAN.pm module that uses
    Test::Reporter to send the results of module tests to the CPAN Testers
    project. Support for CPAN::Reporter is available in CPAN.pm as of
    version 1.88.

    The goal of the CPAN Testers project (<http://testers.cpan.org/>) is to
    test as many CPAN packages as possible on as many platforms as possible.
    This provides valuable feedback to module authors and potential users to
    identify bugs or platform compatibility issues and improves the overall
    quality and value of CPAN.

    One way individuals can contribute is to send test results for each
    module that they test or install. Installing CPAN::Reporter gives the
    option of automatically generating and emailing test reports whenever
    tests are run via CPAN.pm.

GETTING STARTED
  Installation
    The first step in using CPAN::Reporter is to install it using whatever
    version of CPAN.pm is already installed. CPAN.pm will be upgraded as a
    dependency if necessary.

      cpan> install CPAN::Reporter

    If CPAN.pm was upgraded, it needs to be reloaded.

      cpan> reload cpan

  Configuration
    If upgrading from a very old version of CPAN.pm, users may be prompted
    to renew their configuration settings, including the 'test_report'
    option to enable CPAN::Reporter.

    If not prompted automatically, users should manually initialize
    CPAN::Reporter support. After enabling CPAN::Reporter, CPAN.pm will
    automatically continue with interactive configuration of CPAN::Reporter
    options.

      cpan> o conf init test_report

    Users will need to enter an email address in one of the following
    formats:

      johndoe@example.com
      John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
      "John Q. Public" <johnqpublic@example.com>

    Because "cpan-testers" uses a mailing list to collect test reports, it
    is helpful if the email address provided is subscribed to the list.
    Otherwise, test reports will be held until manually reviewed and
    approved. Subscribing an account to the cpan-testers list is as easy as
    sending a blank email to cpan-testers-subscribe@perl.org and replying to
    the confirmation email.

    Users will also be prompted to enter the name of an outbound email
    server. It is recommended to use an email server provided by the user's
    ISP or company. Alternatively, leave this blank to attempt to send email
    directly to perl.org.

    Users that are new to CPAN::Reporter should accept the recommended
    values for other configuration options.

    After completing interactive configuration, be sure to commit (save) the
    CPAN configuration changes.

      cpan> o conf commit

    See CPAN::Reporter::Config for advanced configuration settings.

  Using CPAN::Reporter
    Once CPAN::Reporter is enabled and configured, test or install modules
    with CPAN.pm as usual.

    For example, to force CPAN to repeat tests for CPAN::Reporter to see how
    it works:

      cpan> force test CPAN::Reporter

    When distribution tests fail, users will be prompted to edit the report
    to add addition information.

UNDERSTANDING TEST GRADES
    CPAN::Reporter will assign one of the following grades to the report:

    *   "pass" -- all tests were successful

    *   "fail" -- one or more tests failed, one or more test files died
        during testing or no test output was seen

    *   "na" -- tests could not be run on this platform or version of perl

    *   "unknown" -- no test files could be found (either t/*.t or test.pl)
        or a result could not be determined from test output (e.g tests may
        have hung and been interrupted)

    In returning results to CPAN.pm, "pass" and "unknown" are considered
    successful attempts to "make test" or "Build test" and will not prevent
    installation. "fail" and "na" are considered to be failures and CPAN.pm
    will not install unless forced.

    If prerequisites specified in "Makefile.PL" or "Build.PL" are not
    available, no report will be generated and a failure will be signaled to
    CPAN.pm.

PRIVACY WARNING
    CPAN::Reporter includes information in the test report about environment
    variables and special Perl variables that could be affecting test
    results in order to help module authors interpret the results of the
    tests. This includes information about paths, terminal, locale,
    user/group ID, installed toolchain modules (e.g. ExtUtils::MakeMaker)
    and so on.

    These have been intentionally limited to items that should not cause
    harmful personal information to be revealed -- it does *not* include
    your entire environment. Nevertheless, please do not use CPAN::Reporter
    if you are concerned about the disclosure of this information as part of
    your test report.

    Users wishing to review this information may choose to edit the report
    prior to sending it.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker. Bugs
    can be submitted through the web interface at

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
