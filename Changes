Revision history for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

0.23 Fri Sep 29 14:35:49 EDT 2006

    - changed test.pl/ExtUtils::MakeMaker handling to wrap 'make test'
      execution with a standardized (parsable) string; does not run
      best.pl twice anymore (Jonathan Rockway)

    - added additional test distributions and added tests for diagnostic
      messages explaining each grade (coverage now > 90%)

0.22 Thu Sep 28 23:44:54 EDT 2006

    - added support for future CPAN.pm support for separate requires and
      build_requires prerequisites

    - changed prerequisites report for easier reading and to show requires
      and build_requires individually, if available from CPAN.pm

    - changed test.pl test grading under ExtUtils::MakeMaker from output 
      parsing to determining the success or failure of a separate run of 
      Makefile
      
0.21 Thu Sep 28 07:06:30 EDT 2006

    - added test.pl support with full capture of output (Tim Bunce)

    - added support for "NA" grade when prerequisites are not meta or
      Perl version is too low

    - refactored tests into separate files by grade
    
0.20 Sun Sep 24 22:45:48 EDT 2006

    - fixed RT#21626: "unknown" results will now be reported to CPAN.pm as
      success and will not interrupt module installation (Slaven Rezic)

    - added support for test.pl files -- though under "make", report is based
      on exit code only and no output is collected

    - added several new tests and test distributions for greater coverage and
      confirming bug closure

    - added user feedback for test grade assigned during report generation

    - changed format of test report

0.19 Fri Sep 22 16:54:02 EDT 2006

    - changed test IO capture to IO::CaptureOutput (fixes test issues
      for Perl < 5.8) (Andreas Konig)

0.18 Thu Sep 21 21:03:57 EDT 2006

    - added workaround for a bizarre VERSION() method confict when
      Module::Signature is installed on older Perls (Andreas Konig)
      
    - added note about location of config files for Mac OS X (SKUO)

    - updated "Getting Started" Pod now that CPAN 1.88 is out

    - added first regression tests for pass/fail
    
0.15 Wed Sep  6 19:23:32 EDT 2006

    - fixed broken test() -- all tests were reporting failed

0.14 Wed Sep  6 15:53:52 EDT 2006

    - added configure() for config file generation and interactive config
    
    - removed automatic config file generation from the test() function
    
    - updated getting started documentation to reflect CPAN.pm 
      'o conf init test_report' syntax (as of 1.87_59) and new
      interactive config feature of CPAN::Reporter
    
    - added the 'fail' config value; equivalent to 'yes' if a test failed 
      and 'no' otherwise 
    
    - changed "cc_author" default to "fail"
    
    - added error checks and testing for config file generation

0.13 Tue Aug 29 06:31:38 EDT 2006

0.11 Sat Aug 26 12:20:32 EDT 2006

    - fail-safe test.pl files -- can't determine success for "make test"
      when teed and can't parse for Test::Harness output
    
    - fail-safe output parsing -- if the expected failure string from 
      Test::Harness is not found, report "unknown" instead of fail
    
    - added compatibility for CPAN.pm "reload cpan" command (Andreas Konig)
    
    - added options "debug" and "editor" (Andreas Konig)
