Revision history for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

0.15 Wed Sep  6 19:23:32 EDT 2006

    - fixed broken test() -- all tests were reporting failed

0.14 Wed Sep  6 15:53:52 EDT 2006

    - added configure() for config file generation and interactive config
    
    - removed automatic config file generation from the test() function
    
    - updated getting started documentation to reflect CPAN.pm 
      'o conf init test_report' syntax (as of 1.87_59) and new
      interactive config feature of CPAN::Reporter
    
    - added the 'fail' config value; equivalent to 'yes' if a test failed 
      and 'no' otherwise 
    
    - changed "cc_author" default to "fail"
    
    - added error checks and testing for config file generation

    - added slightly more verbose progress messages, including for CC's and 
      for reports not sent

0.12 Sat Aug 26 19:05:54 EDT 2006

0.11 Sat Aug 26 12:20:32 EDT 2006

    - fail-safe test.pl files -- can't determine success for "make test"
      when teed and can't parse for Test::Harness output
    
    - fail-safe output parsing -- if the expected failure string from 
      Test::Harness is not found, report "unknown" instead of fail
    
    - added compatibility for CPAN.pm "reload cpan" command (Andreas Konig)
    
    - added options "debug" and "editor" (Andreas Konig)
    
    - bumped Tee version requirement
