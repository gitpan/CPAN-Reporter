Revision history for Perl module CPAN::Reporter

0.33 Tue Nov  7 07:37:08 EST 2006

    - Added Test::Harness and Test::More to the modules included as
      part of the toolchain version report

0.32 Tue Nov  7 01:24:14 EST 2006

    - Added versions of module toolchain (e.g. CPAN, ExtUtils::MakeMaker,
      Module::Build, etc.) to test report

    - Added Pod warning about potential privacy issues from sending
      environment and other information as part of the test report

0.31 Mon Nov  6 13:38:57 EST 2006

    - replace broken 0.30 release

0.30 Mon Nov  6 13:29:03 EST 2006

    - changed report output to have a different introductory paragraph for
      each test grade to better clarify the meaning of 'unknown' and 'na'
      results from testing

    - added select environment variables and Perl special variables to
      generated report

    - added some addition clarifications in Pod

0.29 Sat Oct 28 13:36:26 EDT 2006

    *** Backward compatibility warning: See below and 0.28_51 change log ***

        * Config file location on Mac OS X
        * Config option format and semantics for action prompts

    - fixed RT#22557: recursive build directories with no tests will no longer
      cause an "unknown" grade if tests exist at the top-level directory

    - changed action prompt rules; default is always no unless otherwise
      specified -- the suggested rule from interactive configuration has no
      impact on parsing

    - changed default action for edit_report and send_report to "no" and "yes"
      respectively if the grade is pass to avoid holding up successful 
      installations. (Suggested by Michael Schwern)

    - changed several tests to always mock configuration directory; prevents
      OS X config files from being migrated early during testing. (Reported by
      Michael Schwern).

    - added explanation of grade:action pairs during configuration

    - added validation of grade:action pairs during configuration

0.28_51 Mon Oct 23 23:47:33 EDT 2006

    *** Backward compatibility warning: configuration options have changed and
    config directory on OS X has changed ***
    
    - changed config directory on Mac OS X to ~/.cpanreporter instead of
      ~/Documents/.cpanreporter to be more like Unix; automatically moves
      config file if old directory is detected. (RT#22120)

    - changed action prompt configuration option format to support grade-
      specific actions (RT#21690)
    
    - fixed success/failure parsing when recursive make output is included;
      line parsing is now done in reverse and only the first matching line
      is used

    - changed perl version prerequisite logic; report will only be marked
      "na" if a perl version was explicitly set in the prerequisites;
      autodetection of low perl version was removed to eliminate spurious
      matches from recursive makes

    - added tests for report output format
    
0.28 Sun Oct  8 12:47:46 EDT 2006

    - fixed test programs to force cleanup temp directories 
      (due to bug in File::Temp)

0.27 Wed Oct  4 14:04:08 EDT 2006

    *** Emergency bug fix ***
    
    - fixed fatal bug in prereq collection from some versions of CPAN.pm

0.26 Wed Oct  4 09:25:08 EDT 2006

    - fixed prereq tests: requiring "0" will now pass for modules with no 
      $VERSION defined (will show that version '0' is installed)

    - fixed prereq tests for version.pm and bleadperl expansion of
      version numbers when stringified (1.2 becomes 1.200)

    - bumped ExtUtils::MakeMaker prereq version to 6.26 to ensure proper
      globbing of t/*.t files for Test::Harness

0.25 Tue Oct  3 23:00:02 EDT 2006

    - fixed prereq testing: tests are conducted in a perl subprocess to use
      same $ENV{PERL5LIB} as used for testing itself; necessary to support
      prerequisites that may be tested by CPAN.pm but not yet installed
      
    - added special logic for perl prerequisite version checks now that
      CPAN.pm passes it along

    - added tests for prereq reporting

0.24 Sun Oct  1 04:27:51 EDT 2006

    *** Emergency bug fix ***
    
    - added a dummy file to t/dist/NoTestFiles/t to ensure the directory
      is included in the distribution manifest and tarball; otherwise
      NoTestFiles tests fail

0.23 Fri Sep 29 14:35:49 EDT 2006

    - changed test.pl/ExtUtils::MakeMaker handling to wrap 'make test'
      execution with a standardized (parsable) string; does not run
      test.pl twice anymore (Jonathan Rockway)

    - added additional test distributions and added tests for diagnostic
      messages explaining each grade (coverage now > 90%)

0.22 Thu Sep 28 23:44:54 EDT 2006

    - added support for future CPAN.pm support for separate requires and
      build_requires prerequisites

    - changed prerequisites report for easier reading and to show requires
      and build_requires individually, if available from CPAN.pm

    - changed test.pl test grading under ExtUtils::MakeMaker from output 
      parsing to determining the success or failure of a separate run of 
      Makefile
      
0.21 Thu Sep 28 07:06:30 EDT 2006

    - added test.pl support with full capture of output (Tim Bunce)

    - added support for "NA" grade when prerequisites are not meta or
      Perl version is too low

    - refactored tests into separate files by grade
    
0.20 Sun Sep 24 22:45:48 EDT 2006

    - fixed RT#21626: "unknown" results will now be reported to CPAN.pm as
      success and will not interrupt module installation (Slaven Rezic)

    - added support for test.pl files -- though under "make", report is based
      on exit code only and no output is collected

    - added several new tests and test distributions for greater coverage and
      confirming bug closure

    - added user feedback for test grade assigned during report generation

    - changed format of test report

0.19 Fri Sep 22 16:54:02 EDT 2006

    - changed test IO capture to IO::CaptureOutput (fixes test issues
      for Perl < 5.8) (Andreas Konig)

0.18 Thu Sep 21 21:03:57 EDT 2006

    - added workaround for a bizarre VERSION() method confict when
      Module::Signature is installed on older Perls (Andreas Konig)
      
    - added note about location of config files for Mac OS X (SKUO)

    - updated "Getting Started" Pod now that CPAN 1.88 is out

0.17 Sat Sep  9 07:11:08 EDT 2006

    - changed t/03_test_report.t to skip Module::Build tests if 
      Module::Build is not installed

0.16 Fri Sep  8 07:19:25 EDT 2006

    - fixed file mode bug in t/02_config_file_t (Slaven Rezic)

    - added first regression tests for pass/fail
    
0.15 Wed Sep  6 19:23:32 EDT 2006

    - fixed broken test() -- all tests were reporting failed

0.14 Wed Sep  6 15:53:52 EDT 2006

    - added configure() for config file generation and interactive config
    
    - removed automatic config file generation from the test() function
    
    - updated getting started documentation to reflect CPAN.pm 
      'o conf init test_report' syntax (as of 1.87_59) and new
      interactive config feature of CPAN::Reporter
    
    - added the 'fail' config value; equivalent to 'yes' if a test failed 
      and 'no' otherwise 
    
    - changed "cc_author" default to "fail"
    
    - added error checks and testing for config file generation

0.13 Tue Aug 29 06:31:38 EDT 2006

    - added slightly more verbose progress messages, including for CC's and 
      for reports not sent
    
    - minor documentation improvements

0.12 Sat Aug 26 19:05:54 EDT 2006

    - updated docs to indicate that CPAN 1.87_57 supports CPAN::Reporter

0.11 Sat Aug 26 12:20:32 EDT 2006

    - fail-safe test.pl files -- can't determine success for "make test"
      when teed and can't parse for Test::Harness output
    
    - fail-safe output parsing -- if the expected failure string from 
      Test::Harness is not found, report "unknown" instead of fail
    
    - added compatibility for CPAN.pm "reload cpan" command (Andreas Konig)
    
    - added options "debug" and "editor" (Andreas Konig)
    
    - bumped Tee version requirement

0.10 Tue Aug  8 23:56:07 EDT 2006

    - first public release -- support not yet available in CPAN.pm
      main branch
